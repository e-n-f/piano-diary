We just ordered a Yamaha upright piano. It feels like kind of a crazy indulgence, but they do play a lot nicer than the 15-year-old synth that I have now.

I really wish I understood what make some pianos feel so much better than others. They also had a couple of used Steinways that were really nice to play but either cost a fortune or had a messed up finish. The Baldwin felt all mushy and wrong.

I suck at reading music so most of my repertoire is "fake book" versions of Beatles classics and that kind of thing.

Sunday, I believe, was the first time in years (decades?) I have played a song from sheet music actually as written instead of doing it fake book style.

The Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood theme song, since it seemed like it might be easy, and Without Us from Family Ties, since it was next in the book.

I am bad at reading sheet music.

Just fumbled through the Andy Griffith Show

And Meet the Flintstones

And the Muppet Show

And Cheers and Woody Woodpecker

I am trying to play songs as written instead of fake-book style from chords to see if I get any good at it.

Hooray for Captain Spaulding is still beyond me.

I am very slow and error-prone, but capable, at either standard (The Sound of Music, The Trolley Song, How High the Moon) and easy (Flintstones, Muppet Show, Woody Woodpecker) arrangements.

I know I am still not paying any real attention to key signatures, which will bite me. The Sound of Music stretches my left hand for the broken chords

But maybe it will work...


## 2014-06-28

At least made it all the way through Mozart's Sonata in C, although not with a lot of skill. But that's a milestone, right?

I am still so very slow, but the Trolley Song almost sounds like a song now
