We just ordered a Yamaha upright piano. It feels like kind of a crazy indulgence, but they do play a lot nicer than the 15-year-old synth that I have now.

I really wish I understood what make some pianos feel so much better than others. They also had a couple of used Steinways that were really nice to play but either cost a fortune or had a messed up finish. The Baldwin felt all mushy and wrong.

I suck at reading music so most of my repertoire is "fake book" versions of Beatles classics and that kind of thing.


## 2013-10-16

Trying to play the piano from real sheet music after years in the "fake book" world. I am really slow.

Sunday, I believe, was the first time in years (decades?) I have played a song from sheet music actually as written instead of doing it fake book style.

The Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood theme song, since it seemed like it might be easy, and Without Us from Family Ties, since it was next in the book.

I am bad at reading sheet music.

Just fumbled through the Andy Griffith Show

And Meet the Flintstones

And the Muppet Show

And Cheers and Woody Woodpecker

Bought _Christmas Songs the World Over_ from Urban Ore, according to receipt within.


## 2014-06-26

I am trying to play songs as written instead of fake-book style from chords to see if I get any good at it.

Hooray for Captain Spaulding is still beyond me.

I am very slow and error-prone, but capable, at either standard (The Sound of Music, The Trolley Song, How High the Moon) and easy (Flintstones, Muppet Show, Woody Woodpecker) arrangements.

I know I am still not paying any real attention to key signatures, which will bite me. The Sound of Music stretches my left hand for the broken chords

But maybe it will work...

## 2014-06-27

Officially creeped out that Facebook knows what sheet music I was looking at on eBay the other day.


## 2014-06-28

At least made it all the way through Mozart's Sonata in C, although not with a lot of skill. But that's a milestone, right?

I am still so very slow, but the Trolley Song almost sounds like a song now

eBay: 1920s Sheet Music Lot of 150+ Retro Great Art

## 2014-11-21

All these San Francisco addresses in this eBay sheet music from South Carolina. Wonder what instrument Frank L. Taylor of 6410 Geary played.


## 2014-11-24:

My indulgence lately has been bulk piano-vocal pop sheet music from the
1920s through the 1950s on eBay. Bulk because I'm trying to get good at
sight-reading melodies I've never even heard before, and you can only do
that with a steady supply of new songs. Originals instead of reprints,
because reprints are relentlessly focused on the few songs that were
popular at the time and are still remembered today, instead of the mass
of relative failures, and even on just the good parts of those songs
instead of the whole things. That time range, because I'm still terrible
at reading full piano arrangements, and it's the transitional period
between 1923, when the ukulele craze and May Singhi Breen got publishers
to start including chord names on their music, and the Beatles, when pop
songwriting shifted from songs that work well on piano to ones that work
well on guitar. It's all kind of ridiculous, but it's still cheaper and
smaller and more educational than a lot of things I've spent money and
space and time on.

Retroactive estimate (2015-05-07) of 1900 songs played in 2014 (sight-reading
melodies and fake book chords): 1000 in the Armed Forces Song Folio and 900 in loose sheets.

## 2015-01-08

British pop sheet music still retained its distinctive notation, with solfege above and chords below, as late as 1952


## 2015-01-27

Tonight has been kind of a breakthrough in music reading for me. I am still terrible at it, but I am getting whole chains of chords in sequence with few mistakes, and repositioning relative to the previous notes instead of doing everything in absolute terms. Clearly there is something to the claims that it is important not to have to look at your hands, because I am doing a lot less looking at my hands, but that doesn't explain what's changed since last night, when I was struggling through the various arrangements of Alexander's Ragtime Band.

Played several songs from "Your favorite songs Complete! With Words and Music" beginning with Red Roses for a Blue Lady. I can't give you anything but love, For me and my gal, Ghost of a Chance, How Ya Gonna Keep Em Down on the Farm, Let a Smile be your umbrella, That's my desire, Stars Fell on Alabama, sweet Lorraine, Take me in your arms. Ain't Misbehaving is still far too hard to even get part of the way through though.

(Can I talk to you some time about how you learned to read piano chords at speed? I can read music but am slow and clunky)

## 2015-02-06

Made a couple of decent runs through "All of Me." There is hope that I can do this. Still haven't dared to try to do anything with 3 flats or 2 sharps yet though.

## 2015-02-07

Convention:

the Bb/C# combo. The b and # are written next to each other, but there's only one plausible interpretation, so that's what it is.

This is definitely a milestone: made it through the whole "Hello I Must Be Going/Hooray for Captain Spaulding" suite, even the part in Ab when I haven't even been daring to play anything with 3 flats let alone 4. I am clumsy and slow and terrible, but I am literate!

## 2015-02-11

Very inconvenient for online research that copyright kicks in exactly at the moment in music notation history that I am eager to understand

## 2015-02-15

Rastall's "Notation of Western Music" at least mentions "fake book" chords.

## 2015-02-23

I can play "Mister Sandman," with its oom-pah harmony, pretty much as written. Not well, not with grace, but without a lot of hesitation either.

Yesterday I did kind of decently with "Get out and get under the moon" too. Steph asked me afterward if I could please play some songs she knew instead of 1930s pop that she's never heard of. My plan is to play as many songs as possible until I get good at it.

## 2015-02-28

So mystifying that the late 60s-early 70s piano-buying boom came at the same time as the sheet music publishing industry was collapsing

It's been a good couple of days. I am still pretty terrible, but I think I am on the edge of decent.

Two days ago I ran through a bunch of familiar pop—Pennies from Heaven, Lullaby of Broadway, Unforgettable, The Coffee Song, Swinging on a Star, How Much is that Doggie in the Window, Heart and Soul, Red Sails in the Sunset, Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, You Are My Sunshine, Treasure of Sierra Madre, Singing in the Rain, Peter Cottontail, Witch Doctor, Music Music Music, the Trolley Song—and I'm not great, but I can do it.

Other stuff is still beyond me, though. Nights on Broadway, Making Our Dreams Come True, The Girl from Ipanema, The Glow Worm, attempts at Tori Amos or Beatles stuff: essentially anything where the rhythm is complicated or sparse. And a sharp or one or two flats is still all I can really manage.

(I couldn't have even told you until yesterday that the third sharp is G. I never even learned that.)

Yesterday: sticking a foot into classical. Ran through Fur Elise several times. I never really got the rhythm before, that it starts with a pick-up. Now I get it.

Random Mozart stuff from that compilation. Surprisingly a lot of his stuff is easier than pop, since I guess I am better at reading broken chords than full chords. I still fall apart at the harder keys though. His stuff is all so far up the keyboard that I am better at treble leger lines now.

## 2015-03-20

Things I am bad at:

* Complicated rhythms, especially when in 3 instead of 4

* Especially whatever it's called where things hit just before the start of the measure instead of on the beat

* Big block chords

* Leger lines beyond the first few

* Key signatures with more than 2 flats or 1 sharp

* Arpeggios

## 2015-03-29

Still very rhythmically clunky, but getting better. Finally started giving pieces in Eb an honest chance instead of immediately deferring them. More than one sharp is still scary.

## 2015-04-25

Avoiding the temptation to scrap all these slides and write a new talk about the evolution of the written form of 20th century pop music

## 2015-04-26

Eb is great now. I've been playing all kinds of Eb.

Three sharps is still impossible to do well.

I just felt downright competent at Rambling Rose, After Graduation Day, and Did You Ever Get that Feeling in the Moonlight. Lots of errors, but fluid, somehow.

## 2015-04-29

Tried to play some of the Burt Bacharach anthology and it was a disaster. Always Something There to Remind Me (either arrangment), The Look of Love, just terrible. But That's What Friends Are For was less bad, especially if I stopped trying to make sense of the rhythm and just played the notes, and Close To You was actually pretty decent. It's the rhythm that always kills me.

Returned to the sheet music and That's When I Learned To Love You went very smoothly, although still with plenty of mistakes of course. I apparently know the tropes of late 20s music, and it doesn't try to do anything rhythmic. Also Don't Cry Little Girl was OK, because apparently I know the tropes of 1950s music too.

The 60s and beyond are a different beast.

## 2015-04-30

Sight-reading through "A Gal in Calico" just now really makes me think, I can do this. No, it's not all right, and I know there are plenty of things I can't do at at all still. But there are songs, and this is one of them, where it really does pretty much work.


## 2015-05-07

This would have been an insanely expensive way to learn before the current era of cheap bulk used eBay sheet music.

It looks like I had to sight-read about 1900 melodies to get from being a by-ear-plus-chords pianist to being a decent fake-book pianist…
and about another 900 songs to get to my current shaky adequacy at reading full pop piano arrangements.

## 2015-06-09

Piano hacks: "bell," "toy piano," arpeggio to fake chords bigger than your hand, chromatic chord shifts independent of key. Any others?

## 2015-06-20

Milestone: got distracted while playing "(Most of all) I want your love" and was thinking about something else (the Hammond organ in Vincennes) while continuing to play. Multitasking!

"And it still goes" has a really smooth arrangement, even if I still make a ton of errors

## 2015-06-23

Just pulled out "Everyone says I love you." I remember being completely flummoxed by this a few months ago. Now I am still stumbling as far as keeping in time goes, but the music is just fine.

I can't tell if the arrangements in the Gem Dance Folio of 1926 No. 2 are really as repetitive as they seem or whether I just know the tropes by now.

## 2015-06-30

"You walk by" is the kind of song that makes me think I really can do it. It's in C, and it doesn't do anything complicated with rhythm, so it pretty much works.

## 2015-07-01

Fats Waller's "My fate is in your hands" feels good too. I'm sloppy but close.

## 2015-07-03

The sheet music to "Ain't Misbehavin'," repeatedly, hopefully getting a little better each time

## 2015-07-05

I've spent almost the whole three-day weekend running through the standards of The Definitive Jazz Collection. (Up through Nice Work If You Can Get It so far, which I remember bailing out of before.)

I tried a zillion times to play Ain't Misbehaving correctly, but correct performance still eludes me. Over the Rainbow and The South of Music weren't much better, so it's not just because it's particularly hard.

But the reading seems to be going great even if the performance isn't. The only things I've skipped over are the Jobim ones and a couple of others that are clearly meant for guitar, because I can't get the rhythm right and they are all about rhythm.

There was one thing in there that got up to 6 flats, which is kind of insane. It was half accidentals in that section anyway so it was a mess however you notate it.

## 2015-07-13

A few days ago I was feeling terrible. Tons and tons of mistakes on things I ought to be able to do better. My best theory: switching glasses after breaking my regular ones must have shifted my visual perception slightly, just enough to make it hard.

But yesterday evening I was feeling really good about myself. My tempos are still uneven and I am still terrible at:

  * Big block chords
  * Hard keys (>3 flats, >2 sharps)
  * Lots of accidentals
  * Left hand in the treble clef
  * Bouncing bass
  * Rolled bass chords
  * Deep ledger lines

but there was a lot of stuff that I just *knew* without having to think about it. Fluency.

This is with about 5" of additional songs played (plus folios, duplicates etc.), which means 333 or so on top of the previously accounted "shaky adequacy" playing:

* 13" of fake book reading (~867) + army navy hit hit (~1000)
* 14" of full arrangements (~933)

"Second Fiddle" is the smoothest-playing country thing ever. "Rags to Riches" has a really weird bridge that feels like an unrelated song.


## 2015-07-26

Library books due:

* The Frank Sinatra anthology


## 2015-08-10

Sparse rhythms are still hard. Saturday night I played a couple of songs from the modern Sesame Street Songbook and then the 1971 versions, and the 1971 is easier because it is fuller, even though the new one is trying to be easier by being sparse.

The modulation in the Sesame Street theme is still very hard, from F to A with three sharps.

Ab is still hard with the four flats, but I can mostly do it. A is just awful.

I am doing a *lot* better with chromatic slides.

I tried playing Tuxedo Junction with its bouncing bass a few times. I am still bad at bouncing my left hand around but not as terrible as before.

"Little Boy Blue" in 1934 Berlin Dance Folio I was playing almost all the bass chords without thinking about it, even ones I would have previously been skipping the bottom or top note in.



## 2015-08-13

Library books due:

* Ain't misbehavin' : the new Fats Waller musical show.
* The Cambridge history of American music

## 2015-08-19

I'm playing through Volume 5 of the Armed Forces Song Folio, and I'm really hitting it. Just did "Ruby Gentry" with all those chromatics and triplets and it just worked. Barely even looking at my hands.

Of course whatever the next one in the book was was a disaster. But still!


## 2015-08-23

Now doing vol 1 (i.e., 2) of Army Navy Hit Kit again. In "Give me the simple life" finally sort of got the feel for swinging the melody into the previous measure.


## 2015-08-24

And then I get to "My Heart Stood Still" and I am basically playing it at half tempo. All those big magestic chords and I can play them but I can't play them fast.


## 2015-08-25

Zip-a-dee doo-dah is still a giant pain. I really want to have the left hand hit on 1 even if the melody is pushing forward. A void in the rhythm is terrible.


## 2015-08-26

I have crossed over some threshold of competence lately. No, I am not good. No, I can't even play any single song through without fumbling something. No, I still can't play with more than two sharps. But my sight reading is downright *adequate*.

And oh yeah, bolero rhythms are working great now. Beguine I guess too, as in "begin the."


## 2015-08-30

"Kokomo, Indiana" is another one that I can basically play but only at half tempo.


## 2015-09-02

Library books due:

* Stardust melody : the life and music of Hoagy Carmichael
* Stephen Foster and the rise of American popular culture


## 2015-10-14

I'm doing so much better in the past few days. In particular "I'd be lost without you" where I worked through it on Monday enough times that I was really feeling good. Steph took notice and started watching me and of course the attention meant I fluffed it. But so much more smooth than before on that and so many other songs.

Not everything: I barely made it through "Broadway Rhythm" last night and "I wished on the moon" tonight. But competence is in sight.

## 2015-10-18

A weird Taylorist efficiency to these 1950s piano arrangements I like so much. No unnecessary motions. Maximum musicality per note played.

## 2015-10-27

Maybe this should be the day that I declare competence. Not perfect by any means, but I am really hitting it.

There are 7 shelf-inches of music sitting on top of the piano, so to add to the numbers from July 13, that's like a total of 3600 songs played.

I am still terrible at more than two sharps, rolled bass chords, keeping in rhythm, and at playing absolutely anything newer than 1970, but I feel basically fluent now.

## 2015-10-31

Those 7 shelf-inches of music are exactly 430 songs.

To reiterate: there were previously 28 shelf-inches plus 6 inches. So that's 2519 songs in loose sheets, plus the folios and stuff.

(There are another 5 inches of reserves on the piano, and 17 inches in the back room.)

Adding the thousand or so Hit Kit songs, if these are all actually 2-minute pop songs, that's 117 hours, which is way too low for a year and a half of doing this for an hour or two almost every night.

## 2015-11-01

Actually did a half-decent job on a song with a backbeat ("The Candy Man"). Maybe 1960s pop will not elude me forever.

Weird how little music publishers care whether they print the canonical version of a song or some other arrangement


## 2015-11-09

Wow, I am really hitting it tonight. The Jul 1951 and Jan 1951 Armed Forces Song Folios, preceded by some out of order from the bound volume that includes What A Difference A Day Made, although I didn't hit my stride until I had moved over to the loose issues.

I'm not necessarily actually playing better, but something happened to my confidence, where I'm just doing it, not really thinking about it, hardly looking at the keys, and it is smooth and just works. A really good feeling.

Can I keep it up, or will I be back to fumbling tomorrow?

## 2015-11-10

Yeah, something has really stuck from yesterday. I am probably really not playing any better, but I have so much more confidence about it.


## 2015-11-21

The confidence still comes and goes.

Instead of sight reading, in the past four evenings I've played "How High The Moon" 115 times, mostly with metronome at 71 or 75 bpm, and finally have a demonstration that I can play a whole song through basically in correct rhythm without blatant mistakes.

The embarrassing part was that for the first 100 times, I was playing the first two measures wrong (starting on D instead of B) without noticing.


## 2015-12-03

Tonight I notice myself getting F-C-F splits right in the bass instead of cheating and just playing two notes of it as a single interval.


## 2015-12-08

Definitely getting better at bass chords. "Have yourself a merry little Christmas" just now, and I think I hit them all, if awkwardly.



## 2015-12-10

Library books due:

* The new Sammy Cahn songbook
* The great songs of Harry Warren : from 42nd Street to Hollywood

## 2015-12-18

Made it through "Stormy Weather:" not great, but it's in Ab and I remember giving up on it before


## 2015-12-23

Put away another 254 songs (4 inches).

So that makes (5 + 14 + 7 + 5) * 63 = 1953 songs played this year, plus folios and stuff?

There are about 6 inches of folios on the stack, so that's another 375+ songs (probably more, since they are denser than loose sheets), plus whatever ones I got from the library.

Harry Warren, Sammy Cahn collections from the library recently. What else?


## 2015-12-31

Library books due:

* Cole Porter, a musical anthology
* The great songs of George Gershwin

## 2016-01-01

Retroactively:
I don't know where I got 1953 songs in 2015 above, because it seems like it ought to be:

* 933 through may, as cited 2015-07-13
* 333 (5") through jul 13
* 289 hit kit 5 (136) , 2 (153)
* 430 songs (7"), 10-27
* 16 Jul 51, Jan 51 hit kit
* 115x how high the moon
* 254 songs (4")
* 375 in folios

for a total of 2745, plus at least a hundred or two unrecorded in folios.
It still seems low compared to the 5818 in 2016.
At least I kept better track after this point.

## 2016-01-03

The new year has brought some new confidence and skill. I've really been hitting it solidly last night and today. My tempos are still uneven but there's all kinds of things that I can just do, like running through the Oklahoma folio. Starting to feel more comfortable with four flats and two sharps, although still clunky with that. 60s song rhythms still difficult.

## 2016-01-19

So far this year: 184 songs in loose sheets, plus

* 7 Oklahoma
* 43 "Robbins 50 favorites" (wrong cover)
* 16 Hill and Range #2
* 15 Hill and Range #4
* 12 How the west was won
* 16 Hill and Range #3
* 12 Paramount #8
* 15 Robbins Hollywood #5
* 11 Robbins Hollywood #4
* 13 (first 13) Memory Song Chest
* 34 Nat King Cole

* 25 in the "keep" stack

so that's 403 songs in 18 days. Whew!



And some more:

* 6 The Sound of Music
* 10 The Wizard of Oz

Do-Re-Mi in particular makes me feel strangely literate, because even though I'm bumbling through all the chords, I totally get what it's doing. I've got the abstraction even if not the execution.

"The Night is Young" is the one a couple of days ago that I was bumbling but even the fact that I could bumble means I am almost there.

I am still bad at more than one sharp, but bumbled through Cosi Cosa a little better than previously.

Still terrible at rock rhythms.

## 2016-02-02

Additional in January:

* 162 songs from the Donald E Vaughan promotional copy set

Take away those 25 in the keep stack above.

* 63 keep stack
* 9 Army-Navy Hit Kit Issue "T"

All of this still on the piano so don't double count it.


I think that is 628 songs in the month, plus whatever misc I forgot about.


It is terrible to be so close to being good and yet to still be so bad.

## 2016-02-08

Friday night tried to play the Harold Arlen folio from SF Public Library and was just terrible.

But was cranking all day Saturday and Sunday, and together with tonight replayed all of volume 7 of the Armed Forces Song Folio:

* 136  Armed Forces Song Folio Vol 7

## 2016-02-15

And this weekend:

* 136 Armed Forces Song Folio Vol 5

## 2016-02-21

I am getting to be half decent at Ab. "Baubles, Bangles, and Bows" just now.

And Cole Porter's "So In Love," so maybe Ab really does work.

## 2016-02-25

I am doing pretty well in general, but "Talk to Me" (from Armed Forces Song Folio) is interestingly tricky. It is full of triplets, so the parts that aren't triplets I keep wanting to swing like crazy, like it's a 12/8 march or something.

## 2016-02-27

"A lot of livin' to do:" I can play the notes, but the bass rhythm is impossible, even in isolation.

* ONE two three four FIVE six SEVEN eight
* one TWO three four FIVE six SEVEN eight

The transgression that rock committed was telling the world that they could rest on one.

* 134? Armed Forces Song Folio #8

minus the Peter Gunn instrumental and some blues with a zillion accidentals that were just beyond me to make it through

Took a week instead of a weekend this time since I got sick

## 2016-02-27

* 9 On A Clear Day You Can See Forever folio

## 2016-02-29

* 80? The Definitive Jazz Collection (88 minus the Jobim ones and maybe another one or two)
* 92 Keep stack
* 6 more Donald Vaughan
* 8 Beatlemania #1

So that's 601 songs played in February. All put away now to try to keep the months better separated.

## 2016-03-03

For song-to-time scaling, last night timed how long it took to play some songs:

* 5 24:43
* 1 05:40
* 4 18:09

So that's 291 seconds per song, 4:51

## 2016-03-12

Slow start this month!

* 136 Armed Forces Song Folio #9

## 2016-03-13

Banged my way through Beethoven's 5th Symphony twice tonight. It was terrible, but I could make it through, unlike when I downloaded it Feb 2nd.

Getting reasonably comfortable with 4 flats. Better with 2 sharps than before but still screw it up all the time.

## 2016-03-16

* 29   Gem Dance Folio for 1941

I finally made it through "I Left My Heart in San Francisco!" A disaster, but I didn't get scared off.

## 2016-03-26

Baby Doll by Kenyon Hopkins (Song Folio Jan 1957) has an interestingly difficult ostinato an octave up. Getting better at it but still clunky.

## 2016-03-27

* 160 Armed Forces Song Folio

(T, Jan-Mar-Jul 51, Jan-Feb-Mar-Apr-Jun-Sep-Oct-Dec 56, Jan-Apr-May-Jun 57, Jan-Feb-Mar-May 63)

I was good yesterday morning, and then I was bad again by last night, and I'm sort of OK now. I wish I understood what makes me so uneven. Sometimes I feel like I've really got it, but it doesn't last.

## 2016-06-05

* 10+ runs through Ev'ryone Says I Love You

## 2016-06-07

And let this be remembered as the weekend when I found out that I really could play Mozart and the Beatles, at least if they didn't use too many sharps.

(16th notes are still awkward, though, and the backbeat still doesn't come naturally to me, especially under triplets.)

## 2016-06-09

The early-baroque stuff makes me feel amazingly competent because harmonic and rhythmic and melodic structure hadn't been invented yet. Two basically-unrelated noodly melody lines going at the same time in even rhythms? Sure, I can read that!

* 66 The Complete Beatles Volume 1 (skipping over the other songs with more than 3 sharps)

## 2016-06-19

Quanno Staje Cu Mme' (in 45 Hits Of Our Times from Italy) was kind of a remarkable feeling: I was just plowing through the chorus, triplets and 16th notes and all, as if it was completely natural. It's kind of the same song as What A Difference A Day Made so maybe it helps to start with a sense of what it's going to do.

## 2016-06-21

Type all day, piano all night, ache all morning


## 2016-06-23

## 2016-07-06

* Les grands succes d'Edith Piaf.
* World Charts presents The French songbook ; songs the French people love
* Edith Piaf memorial album : twenty-two internationally famous selections


## 2016-07-10

July!

* 20 World Charts Presents the French Songbook
* 50 Lullaby of Broadway and 49 Harry Warren Movie Showstoppers
* 75 loose sheets

Still alternating between feeling good and feeling clumsy. Still terrible at more than 3 flats and more than 2 sharps.

## 2016-07-15

* 34 loose sheets

## 2016-07-26

* 33 mostly from Great Songs of Broadway

in the lobby of the Bonneville Hot Springs hotel the other day, my first reasonable access to a piano in a week. I am not great, but I was reading pretty fluently, and nobody tried to chase me out of the lobby.

I had tried to play a few things on a street piano in Portland, but it was in such bad shape it hardly counts

## 2016-07-27

* 19 Keith Prowse' 7th Song and Dance Album
* 12 Fifth Paramount Song Folio
* 12 25 Hits Through the Years

on the out-of-tune lobby piano of the Crystal Crane Hot Springs

## 2016-08-01

* 34 loose sheets
* 28 Famous Song Hits


So 317 songs in July. Not terrible considering we were traveling for half the month.

## 2016-08-03

I have to say, the fact that I could play songs, in public, without rehearsal, for 2+ hours at a time, twice in a week, with a stopped-up ear, on poorly-maintained pianos, must mean that I have passed the "I can do it" milestone. I am not great, but I can do it.

That's after a little over two years of solid work: fake-book sight reading from June 2014 through Jan 2015, and then full arrangements since then.

(June 2014 per overdue notice from Oakland Library for Irving Berlin, Broadway, and movie musical songs that I wouldn't have previously known. In April 2014 I was checking out rock stuff that I would have known the melodies to already.)

So why I am I still so clumsy sometimes, when I am conscious of what I am doing instead of being able to just do it?

## 2016-08-31

* 39 loose sheets
* 30 "30 years, 30 hits"
* 21 The Passing Parade
* 100 20s 30s & 40s Showstoppers
* 32 Armed Forces Song Folio: Sep 56, Aug 56, Feb 55, Mar 55
* 47 Rodgers and Hart Song Book

So 269 songs in August. Slowest month this year, but no surprise given all the time with Dot in the hospital.

## 2016-09-05

* 16 from World's Greatest Hits of the Forties

In Murrieta

## 2016-09-18

Last night I found myself trying to play some grace notes in Bluebirds in the Moonlight (5th Paramount Song Folio). Not very good at it though.

I am still really bad at giant treble chords where both hands are playing part of some mass of notes at the top of the treble clef and beyond.

Getting better at key of Ab and a little better at D, but still not good.

## 2016-09-25

Getting more comfortable with complicated rhythms. In particular, made it through The Impossible Dream.

## 2016-10-01

* 11 loose sheets
* 33 Song Hits of the Fabulous 50s (Tea For Two Cha Cha is too hard)

So that's 455 songs played in September

I am actually pretty decent now, although still with several gaping holes in my skills

## 2016-10-08

* 27 loose sheets ("keep")
* 42 loose sheets


## 2016-10-11

If there's anything I've learned from YouTube piano videos, it's that no one ever plays the original, published arrangement of anything

## 2016-10-16

* 128 Armed Forces Song Folio #4
* 11 "keep"

and several more runs through Pennies from Heaven, Rock around the Clock, How High the Moon, and Baby Doll, but I don't know how to count that


## 2016-10-18

* 96 loose sheets

So 382 songs played in October, plus whatever dupes I missed

## 2016-11-07

Getting better at using my right hand to play the top of a too-big left-hand chord when needed, sometimes without thinking about it too much.

I spent an hour and a half last night filming myself trying to get through Stars Fell On Alabama once without making any big mistakes. I tend to get something wrong in the bridge every time. (Chosen because it doesn't have any page turns, it's in C, it doesn't do anything crazy. Still not quite enough.)

Library books due:

## 2016-12-18

* If I cheat now and play music that is written in the key of E as if it were written in E♭, will I ever learn to play in E? #pianocapo

## 2016-12-22

* 14 The King and I vocal score
* 3 Knuth's Fantasia Apocalyptica

I'm finally starting to actually pay some attention to notated swing instead of just ignoring it and treating it as if it was all marked as straight eighth notes

I can basically deal with four flats or two sharps now without thinking about it too much. But the three-sharp version of Getting To Know You is still too much.

"The Roar of the Greasepaint" is probably the first stuff in 6/8 that I've ever felt fairly comfortable with instead of stumbling. (Dec 13). But (Dec 17) it gets trickier later in the book.

* 18 Christmas Songs You Love to Sing

Apparently I am basically OK (although certainly not smooth) with 1960s and 1970s stuff for the most part. Haven't tried to work into the 1980s or 1990s yet. Rhythms still too hard for me to read: Joy to the world (Jeremiah was a bullfrog), The continental walk, Monday Monday.

Peter Gunn's ostinato is really hard for me to deal with, especially with the right hand in the bass clef, and triplets over the uneven left hand rhythm.

* 35 100 Greatest Hits of the 60s and 70s (last 35)
* 13 loose sheets (1960s)
* 18 Roar of the Greasepaint
* 30 Gem Dance Folio for 1941 (and I can do Lovely Lagoon now, although clumsily)
* 77 The Joy of Christmas (but they're short)
* 26 Carols and Songs of Christmas (also short)
* 21 loose sheets (Christmas)
* 23 Star Dance Folio #34
* 12 Rainbow Album #4
* 27 Manhattan Dance Folio #3
* 31 loose sheets
* 30 Sammy Kaye #1

I can play stuff from the 80s too! Especially if I cheat and play key of E stuff in Eb. Hard key signatures are still hard. (Dec 19)

* 28 The Best 4 TV Themes

Dec 20: I feel right now about 80s+ music about the way I did about "Do Re Me" on Jan 19: I am not getting it right, but the failures are mere mistakes, not an inability to even contemplate it.

The thing that *is* still basically impossible is sparse rhythms. "The Schuyler Sisters" from Hamilton has some places that I can't count because there's not enough context around it. I need to try "A lot of livin' to do" again.

(Which is still the weird thing about "easy piano" arrangements: they are all about being as sparse as possible, which makes me wonder why rests come so much more easily to everyone else. Also weird that easy piano stuff prefers close note clusters in the bass to wider intervals. I am bad at left-hand clusters.)

Cheating and playing B in Bb opens the door to even more things.

* 6 loose sheets (1980s)
* 22 The best of what's popular now!

1980s arrangements are all boring and terrible. A lot of work to play with very little payoff in harmony or interest. They are dedicated to reproducing the recorded rhythm section.

* 12 Hamilton (through The Room Where It Happens)

A lot of it still very awkward through sparseness or weird harmony or complicated rhythm or things that are just hard to reach.

* 4 Billy Joel Piano Solos (through Baby Grand)

Arranged in an annoying style where the left hand is clustery and keeps moving at the same time as the right.

* 4 Top Hits of 1989 (through Shake for the Skeik)

The Love In Your Eyes is the stupidest 80s arrangement yet.

* 2 loose sheets many times (The Peanut Vendor, Baby It's Cold Outside)

Baby is easy because it's just vamping, no melody, so the repetition is to try to figure out how to get some melody in. I have spent enough time playing stupid 80s rhythm now that I can do The Peanut Vendor from 1930 basically fine now, even though it was hard a couple of weeks ago, so that's progress.

## 2016-12-29

Continuing the vacation habit of giving neglected hotel lobby pianos some attention

## 2017-01-07

The 1982 arrangement of Allentown in 50 Popular Giants #1 may not actually be easier to play than the 2001 arrangement, but it's a lot more natural

* 3 Allentown, Cornflake Girl, You Were Always On My Mind

On the sadly deteriorated piano at the Kauai Beach Resort (4331 Kauai Beach Dr, Lihue, Hawaii):

* 38 Song Hits of the Fabulous 50s
* 6 Song Hits of the Fabulous 50s (starting again)
* 8 The King and I Vocal Score (p108-131)

So that's 511 songs in December, for 5818 songs in 2016!

## 2017-01-08

The "more to call your name" measure of Baby Won't You Please Come Home (in the Sinatra 100 compilation) is the first time I think I have ever played something that anticipated the downbeat with both hands and just got it right the first time. Lots of other weird stuff going on with harmony in that song though. (Jan 7)

Also in "A Foggy Day in London Town" (Jan 8). In other cases I still really want the left hand to hit on 1 though.

"For once in my life", in 12/8 with a backbeat, is really hard for me to feel correctly.

* 21 Burt Bacharach Anthology (through On My Own)



## 2017-01-09

Library books due:

* One night only : the greatest hits
* The best of Billy Joel
* Anthology

## 2017-01-11

* 14 50 Popular Hits #1 (thru Piano Man; recording now since the bookmark is falling out)

"Faithfully" is too hard in key and rhythm—skipped. Also Rhythm in the Sky
"Tell her about it" rhythm is hard but I fumbled through it

## 2017-01-15

* 28 loose sheets
* 100 20s 30s and 40s Showstoppers
* 100 Frank Sinatra Centennial Songbook

## 2017-01-21

* 9 Cabaret Vocal Selections
* 136 Armed Forces Song Folio #7
* 18 Marx Bros songs from http://www.marx-brothers.org/music/sheetmusic.htm (Animal Crackers through Love Happy and a couple others)
* 4 loose sheets
* 12 Beatlemania #1 (through Girl)

Hard keys and rhythms in Cabaret, but I can stumble through it. They like modulating between C and Db.

I guess it's been a little over a year since the previous run through Song Folio #7. I feel like there were some I still couldn't do last time but didn't say anything about it then. All good this time other than a little rhythmic bumbling with 6/8 and rock.

The Beatles stuff is still weird, I think because my knowledge of the songs is fighting with what the arrangers thought was important to incorporate (all the bass rhythms).

I am still pretty much slopping over swung 8ths in older material because I can get away with it. Stuff from the 70s you've really got to read the 16th notes. Also continuing to ignore grace notes, but doing pretty much all optional melodic ornaments.

Finally dawned on me how circle of fifths relates to modulation. Going up a full step costs you 2 sharps. Going up a half step costs you 7 sharps or 5 flats, so you are really restricted if you want to have a reasonable key on both sides of the modulation.

## 2017-02-12

* 13 loose sheets
* 6 Lennon & McCartney Retrospective (through Oh My Love)
* 11 Hamilton (through The Room Where It Happened)

"What'd I Miss" is impossible to play reasonably. The rest is just hard.

* 5 The Heights (through No Me Diga)
* 4 Pink Floyd The Wall

Reasonably playable but tons of rhythmic variation and sparseness

* 44 Armed Forces Song Folio #8 (through They Can't Take That Away From Me)

"Peter Gunn" rhythm is too hard to play right.

* 9 Country the 1st Top 25 of 1982 (the rest)
* 13 What's Popular Now! Level 3 #5
* 26 The Rose and From The Empire Strikes Back The Imperial March Plus 24

## 2017-02-14

## 2017-02-20

I can basically play three sharps now, although still not with a lot of confidence.

I think the rest of the Wall would probably be OK but it's actually pretty tedious to play

I am feeling very solid some times, and then I get clumsy again. My big failing is hard keys: four or more sharps or flats. Better at them than I used to be at least!

I should probably try more classical: hard keys but no hard rhythms, so I only get one kind of hard at once.

"Shiny" is probably the first thing where I was reading pop 16th notes with no difficulties. No triplets so maybe that's why it works.

Now I know "The Man In The Moon Is A Lady" is from Mame.

Got the piano tuned Tuesday. The high and low notes are better but the G above middle C doesn't seem quite right.

I have started counting rests by wiggling my leg, without meaning to. I guess that makes me better at sparseness.

Got the piano tuning touched up!

## 2017-05-06:

* 2 loose sheets

* 8 Fanny vocal selections

And I seem to be able to play quarter note triplets over an eighth note double backbeat now, as in Goldfinger.

* 26 Gem Dance Folio for 1937

which seems to have no overlap with 1937 #2

## 2017-05-09

* 30 Gem Dance Folio for 1942

The White Cliffs of Dover is especially good

## 2017-05-11

I think I can safely say that I am at the skill level that the Dance Folios targeted. Buy the dance folio, have a party, sight-read through it so your friends can hang out to some recent pop hits.

The Mozart variations are harder than some of his other stuff. He doesn't use hard keys or rhythms or hand stretches, but the two lines going at the same time are tricky enough that I still mess them up.

I am getting a lot more places where you're supposed to play the top note of the bass with your right thumb, and being fairly automatic about it.

Things I still really need to get good at:

* rolled chords (what *are* you really supposed to do with the Bb-Eb-G?)
* keys with many sharps, especially E and B
* grace notes, which I am generally ignoring
* swung 8ths, which I am generally ignoring
* dynamics, which I am completely ignoring

## 2017-05-12

* 30 Gem Dance Folio for 1943

"A Guy 24 and A B-29" makes me feel really competent. It is 1945 "rock" and ultimately it isn't much more substantial than most of the Dance Folio stuff, but in the same way as Do A Deer, it uses a lot of chords, and I basically can hit them all without really trying.

## 2017-05-13

## 2017-05-30

* 34 Lennon & McCartney: A Retrospective

I am sort of coping with keys with lots of sharps, but I am slow and uncertain. I can get why people practice scales instead of just songs. There is probably some set of exercises that would establish the fingerings in my mind.

Pulled out A Lot of Livin' To Do, which I couldn't play on 2/27/16, and now I can. Not exactly smooth, but no fundamental problems.

So 557 songs in May

## 2017-05-31

Now I know what slashes through a note stem mean: http://jennifercluff.blogspot.com/2009/05/slashes-through-note-stems.html

Hamilton vocal score uses this for 32nd notes in Ten Duel Commandments

* 10 Hamilton vocal score: Hurricane, Aaron Burr Sir, Farmer Refuted You'll Be Back, Aaron Burr Sir, My Shot, Schuyler Sisters, Farmer Refuted, You'll be back, Right hand man

I skipped the story of tonight because the key of B still scares me

## 2017-06-02

* 14 A winter's ball, helpless, satisfied, story of tonight reprise, wait for it, redcoat transition, stay alive, ten duel commandments, meet me inside, that would be enough, guns and ships, history has its eyes on you, yorktown, what comes next

Oh I am not good, but I am slogging through

Couldn't make it through We Know

## 2017-06-04

After playing Hamilton, everything else seems downright reasonable.

* 11 Brigadoon vocal selections
* 7 High Spirits vocal selections

## 2017-06-06

"The last night of the world" ("Played on a solo saxophone") is in B, and I basically made it through! Fumbly but there is hope. The saxophone player must hate playing in B too.

I remember Luck Be A Lady being impossibly hard last time I tried it. It's got some awkward key changes, but is basically fine now.

"A song" seems to be about 4 minutes currently, based on 8 songs in 33 minutes, so that means I'm spending 35-40 hours a month playing.

And fake-booked the Schuyler Sisters vocal lines

Two Lost Souls (1955) feels kind of like a proto-double backbeat. When did it really come into use?

## 2017-06-25

Hmm, I think Hamilton actually means oscillating between octaves by the slashes through note bars.

Also gouty right big toe this morning
