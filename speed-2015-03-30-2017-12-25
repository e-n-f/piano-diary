6 57 4 34 strange interlude
7 04 3 18 paper doll
7 17 4 27 yes yes in your eyes
8 01 6 03 in the evening
6 03 3 54 always you
5 28 3 28 me and the boy friend
3 58 2 21 you're like that dreamy moon
7 43 4 24 skyrocket
6 52 3 42 pal that i loved
7 53 3 36 dancing with my shadow
5 51 2 57 love's old sweet song
5 26 2 54 you walk by

7 58 4 45 on the old spanish trail
9 16 5 29 the house is haunted by the echo of your last goodbyte
8 22 4 47 and there you are
